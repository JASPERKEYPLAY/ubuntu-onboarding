---

## 2. What You‚Äôll Need

- A USB drive (at least 8GB)

## 3. Installation Steps

### 3.1 Prepare Installation Media

- Create a bootable USB stick using [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/).
- Place `user-data.yaml` in the appropriate location for autoinstall  
  (for Ubuntu 22.04+, this is typically in a directory called `autoinstall/` at the root of the USB,  
  or as part of a preseed if building a custom ISO).
- Ensure `jk-postinstall.sh` is copied to `/opt/jk-postinstall.sh` on the installation media, or available to the installer.

### 3.2 Start Installation

- Boot the target machine from your USB drive.
- Select **‚ÄúInstall Ubuntu (autoinstall)‚Äù** if available.

### 3.3 Enter Your Details When Prompted

You will be prompted for:

- **Username:**  
  _Type your preferred username (e.g., `arunkumar`)_
- **Hostname:**  
  _Type your device name in the format: `jk-ks-yourname` (e.g., `jk-ks-arunkumar`)_
- **Password:**  
  _Choose a strong password that you will remember_

### 3.4 Automated Setup

The system will automatically install:

- All core company applications and developer tools
- Company wallpaper, lock screen, and boot splash
- Custom branding (logo watermark on the desktop)
- All pre-configured browsers, code editors, utilities, and VS Code extensions

### 3.5 Post-installation Steps

- On first login, you‚Äôll find your environment ready to use.
- **Verify:** Open VS Code, browsers, XAMPP, etc. to ensure all applications are present.
- If anything is missing or not working, contact IT support.

## 4. Troubleshooting

- **Installation doesn‚Äôt start:**  
  - Verify your USB is set as the first boot device in BIOS/UEFI.

- **Applications missing after setup:**  
  - Make sure `jk-postinstall.sh` was executed correctly. Re-run manually if needed.

- **Wallpaper or logo not set:**  
  - Try rebooting, or check for image download/network issues during setup.
